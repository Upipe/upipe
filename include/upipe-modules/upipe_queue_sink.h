/** @file
 * @short Upipe sink module for queues
 *
 * Note that the allocator requires an additional parameter:
 * @table 2
 * @item qsrc @item pointer to queue source pipe
 * @end table
 *
 * This pipe also handles the @ref upipe_set_output and @ref upipe_get_output
 * calls, though the output is only directed towards the qsrc. The purpose
 * of this pseudo-output is to be automatically released when the qsink dies.
 * Technically the pseudo-output doesn't get any input.
 *
 * The typical use case is when using @ref upipe_xfer_alloc. The qsrc has to
 * be the original structure allocated by @ref upipe_qsrc_alloc, but the
 * pseudo-output can be the upipe_xfer pipe that acts as a proxy to the qsrc
 * in a different thread. That way the upipe_xfer is released on termination,
 * and releases in turn the qsrc in the appropriate upump_mgr (thread)
 * context.
