/** @file
 * @short Upipe module creating system timestamps for off-line streams
 *
 * This module is used for pipelines running off-line (for instance to transcode
 * a file to a file). In that case there is no system timestamp in input
 * packets, but some sinks (multiplexers) require system timestamps. This
 * module copies the program timestamp into the system timestamp. Please note
 * that this will only work if all flows use the same program clock, that is
 * if there is only one program involved.
