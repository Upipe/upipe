@section T {Requirements}

Upipe has the following dependencies:

@list
@item a C99 compiler (Upipe won't probably compile with any other compiler
      than gcc >= 4.1)
@item support for Intel atomic built-ins (there is a fallback with semaphores
      for architectures/compilers that don't support them, but it is really
      not recommended)
@item a recent version of
      autoconf (@url http://www.gnu.org/software/autoconf/),
      automake (@url http://www.gnu.org/software/automake/)
      and libtool (@url http://www.gnu.org/software/libtool/)
@end list

Upipe has the following optional dependencies:

@list
@item @url http://www.freedesktop.org/wiki/Software/pkg-config/
      pkg-config to detect installed dependencies
@item @url http://dist.schmorp.de/libev/ libev library and headers
      (only required for the optional libupump-ev library), tested with 4.11.
@item @url http://www.nongnu.org/mkdoc/ mkdoc to compile the documentation
@item @url http://ffmpeg.org/ or @url http://libav.org/ libraries and headers
      for upipe-av, upipe-swscale and upipe-swresample.
      Tested with libav v9.10, and ffmpeg 2.0 up to 4.0.2.
      FFmpeg/libav needs to be configured with --enable-pic --enable-shared.
@item perl is needed in the build process of upipe-av 
@item @url http://www.videolan.org/developers/bitstream.html headers to build
      upipe-ts, upipe-framers, and a few upipe-modules components.
      bitstream should always be fetched from the latest git.
@item @url http://www.videolan.org/developers/x264.html for upipe-x264
@item @url http://x265.org/ for upipe-x265
@item a GL/GLU/GLX and X11 implementation for upipe-gl
@end list

@section T {Build}

Upipe comes with a pretty standard autotools build system, so
@code R
./bootstrap && ./configure && make
@end code
should be enough to build it. Unit tests can be built and run with:
@code R
make check
@end code

@end section

@section T {Execution}

Upipe is a set of developement headers for pipes and librares for
applications, and thus runs inside an application. Simple examples
are however provided in the tests/ and examples/ directories.

@end section

@section T {Debugging}

Upipe's code makes intensive use of the @ref #container_of macro.
Debugging with gdb can be made easier by adding the following lines to your
.gdbinit file:

@code R
set print pretty on
define container_of
    p ((struct $arg1*)((void*)$arg0 - (void*)&((struct $arg1*)0)->$arg2))
end
@end code

Then, supposing you big structure is upipe_foo, and you have a member called
upipe to which you have a pointer (also called upipe), you can call it from
gdb's shell to get a pointer to upipe_foo:

@code R
(gdb) container_of upipe upipe_foo upipe
$5 = (struct upipe_foo *) 0x7f9db9873000
(gdb) print *$5
$6 = {
[...]
@end code
